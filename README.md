TODO: custom log level using sum of powers of 2

eg.

INPUTS=1
BARRIER SPAWNING=2
COLLISION DETECTION=4

etc



program is run with a log state say 63 and that turns on all of the corresponding levels
each log line also has a log state number and that way will be turned on if any of its levels are in the run log state numbers
